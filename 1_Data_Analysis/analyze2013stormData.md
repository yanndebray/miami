# Explore and Analyze Tornadoes from 2013

Welcome to your first live script. This script gives you the opportunity to visualize a large dataset and explore its contents. Follow the instructions provided in each section and complete the interactions. As you progress through the course, you'll learn how to implement the various pieces yourself.


Throughout this course you'll be working with historical data from storm events in the United States. The files include over 40 different types of storm events, and contain information such as geographic location, date, damage cost in dollars, injuries, deaths, and text descriptions of the storm. 


There is a lot of missing data. For example, many events affect a large area, so no specific location is provided. As you explore the data, you'll see these represented as **`NaN`**, which stands for "not a number." Dealing with missing data is an important skill covered later, so don't worry about NaN entries for now.


This script explores the tornado events of 2013. There are many tornadoes in the data set. Nearly all tornado events have information for the location and damage associated with them. This makes tornadoes a great place to start.

As this occurred, an inverted trough set up, bringing snow to much of the area.  Snow amounts were low (under 3 inches) for much of the area.  However, the higher elevations ended up with 6+ inches of snow.|"Three to five inches of snow fell across eastern Hillsborough County."|

This was an unusual synoptic set-up, with low pressure lingering off the coast of southern New England for several days. Snowfall was difficult to forecast due to concerns about precipitation type and boundary layer temperature. In the end, precipitation type turned out to be all snow for much of the area, with most locations receiving 1 to 2 feet of snow.  In addition, the Massachusetts east coast was hit by widespread moderate and pockets of major coastal flooding for two high tide cycles and beach erosion for at least 5 high tide cycles.|"Five to sixteen inches of snow fell across eastern Hillsborough County."|

What made this an amazing storm was the widespread coverage of heavy snowfall.  Most locations received 2 to 2.5 feet of snow!  A stationary band of even heavier snowfall persisted from southwest NH through central MA and on to the southwest across central and western CT. In those areas, reports averaged closer to 2.5 to 3 feet! Isolated thunderstorms were common across the entire region during the height of the storm.\|\|A low pressure system advancing from the Great Lakes region combined forces with a very moist low pressure system moving northeast from the Gulf Coast states. Explosive deepening took place Friday evening, February 8, as a low center moved from the North Carolina coast to south of Nantucket.  Strong high pressure to the north of New England helped ensure that cold air remained in place over the area. Snowfall gained intensity during the afternoon, but during the night, 2 to 3 inch per hour amounts were common throughout the region. The band of heaviest snowfall, with 3 to 5 inches per hour for several hours, extended from southwest NH to central and western CT.  Snow ended in the morning in western and central MA, southwest NH, most of CT and RI, and in the early afternoon across eastern MA.|"Sixteen to twenty-four inches of snow fell across eastern Hillsborough County."|

Most of the damage was to trees, some of which were still at least partially leaved.|"The Automated Surface Observing System at Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (KMHT) recorded a wind gust of 53 mph.  Higher gusts are estimated to have occurred elsewhere in eastern Hillsborough County.  In Nashua, a tree was downed at the intersection of East Dunstable Road and Shelley Drive."|

### Data processing steps
<a id="H_201C1707"></a>

As you explore new data, you'll typically discover there is some "clean\-up" to perform. You won't know this in advance. So, while it looks like the first thing you do is clean the data, that comes after some initial exploration. You'll learn more about the steps below in Modules 3 and 4. 

1.  Click **Run Section** to perform the preprocessing steps and move to the next section.
```matlab
% Put months in correct order
monthOrder = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",...
    "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
events.Month = reordercats(events.Month, monthOrder);
% Set missing Property and Crop Cost to $0
events.Property_Cost(ismissing(events.Property_Cost)) = 0;
events.Crop_Cost(ismissing(events.Crop_Cost)) = 0;
% Add total damage to the table
events.Total_Damage = events.Property_Cost + events.Crop_Cost;
```

**Description of code above**

-  By default, the text in the "Month" variable of the table is ordered alphabetically. The code reorders the categories to match the calendar. This is not necessary but makes the visualizations easier to interpret.  
-  Some events are missing information on the associated property and/or damage caused to property and crops. Missing cost is replaced with 0 as missing information likely means small or no damage to report. 
-  A new variable named  `Total_Damage` is added to the table. This variable is the sum of `Property_Cost + Crop_Cost`. 
<a id="H_ED73F793"></a>

# Part 2: Visualize the Locations of Tornadoes
<a id="H_7746C5B7"></a>

## Plot all tornados above a damage threshold

The code below creates a plot of tornado locations on a map. The size of the markers represents the cost in dollars of the damage caused by the tornado. The slider sets a minimum value for total damage of an event to be included in the plot.  

1.  Click into this section to make it the active section.
2. Click **Run Section** to visualize the results.
3. Click on the map to make the figure active.
4. Above the map Plus (+), Minus (-), and Home icons appear. Click the Plus icon to zoom in.
5. Zoom in further and/or pan on the map by clicking the mouse and dragging the map.
6. Click the Home icon to reset the view.
7. Set a threshold for damage caused by adjusting the slider.
<a id="H_2CF16EA4"></a>
```matlab
minDamage = 0;
```

There is no need to edit the code below. In Modules 3 and 4 you'll learn how to create visualizations and select subsets of data. Then in Module 5 you'll learn how to add an interactive control to interactively modify variable values.

```matlab
% Select tornadoes above a damage threshold set by the slider
tornadoes = events(events.Event_Type == "Tornado" & events.Total_Damage >= minDamage, :);
% Plot the results on a map
geobubble(tornadoes.Begin_Lat,tornadoes.Begin_Lon,tornadoes.Total_Damage, tornadoes.Month);
title("Tornadoes with cost >= $" + minDamage)
```

![figure_0.png](analyze2013stormData_media/figure_0.png)

**Description of code above**

-  A new table with only tornadoes above the damage threshold is created.  
-  The location of tornadoes is plotted. 
<a id="H_99E00D65"></a>

## Plot tornadoes for a given month
<a id="H_73B1FBBD"></a>

Below is a drop\-down menu to explore the location of tornadoes for a given month. Observe how the number and location of tornadoes varies throughout the year. All tornadoes are treated as equal regardless of damage caused.

1.  Run this section.
2. A new figure is created. Use the Minus icon in the plot tools to zoom out until the region visible is similar to the figure in the previous section.
3. Click **Update Code**. This will set the axes limits so they don't change when you select a different month.
4. Select `May` from the drop\-down menu.
5. Explore other months.
```matlab
eventMonth = "March";
```

There is no need to edit the code below. The code recreates the tornadoes table so that all tornadoes are included. By the end of Module 3 you'll be able to select any Event\_Type and create a new table of just that category.

```matlab
tornadoes = events(events.Event_Type == "Tornado", :);
tornadoes = tornadoes(tornadoes.Month == eventMonth, :);
geobubble(tornadoes.Begin_Lat,tornadoes.Begin_Lon);
title("Tornadoes in the month of " + eventMonth)
```

# Part 3: Calculate Group Summary Statistics
<a id="H_029963C7"></a>

## Create a histogram of tornado events
<a id="H_7DB1E095"></a>

In the section above, you may have noticed that some months have more tornadoes than others. This section creates a histogram to show the number of tornadoes by month.

-  Run this section. Which month has the most tornadoes? Is there a tornado season? 
```matlab
tornadoes = events(events.Event_Type == "Tornado",:)

Southerly flow advected gulf moisture into the region and showers and thunderstorms easily formed. Heavy rain, hail, damaging winds and tornadoes occurred throughout the day.|"From eyewitness accounts, radar imagery and a ground survey concluded a long track EF-0 tornado occurred in Montgomery County MD on the afternoon of June 13, 2013.  Peak winds were estimated at 75 mph.  Damage was almost entirely from downed trees.  In that regard numerous homes and a few parked vehicles were damaged by trees falling onto them.  \|\|First damage was noted near the Bretton Woods golf course along River Road.  Damage continued along Bonnie Dale Drive and Glenhurst Ct where several trees were downed in the community.  Also, near the intersection of Turkey Foot Road and Jones Lane in southwest Montgomery County near North Potomac MD a few large trees were over the road.  The tornado raced east at nearly 60 mph to the northern section of Rockville MD.  At least 14 homes were significantly damaged by uprooted trees.  As it continued east to the Norbeck and Aspen Hill area 30 trees were uprooted in the Manor County Golf Club as well as numerous homes damaged in the surrounding communiteis from tree damage.

## Total damage by month

Looking at the histogram, the month of May had far more tornadoes than any other month. Now examine the damage caused by these tornadoes. 

1.  Run this section. A table showing the number of tornadoes for each month and the selected statistic is created. A bar plot shows the results.
2. Use the drop\-down menu to change the statistic calculated for each month.
```matlab
stat = "sum";
```

There is no need to edit the code below. In Module 4 you'll learn how to calculate statistics on groups in your data. Here, the code calculates the chosen statistic for each month on the `Total_Damage` variable in the table.

```matlab
tornadoes = events(events.Event_Type == "Tornado",:);
% Group tornadoes by month and calculate the selected stat
cost = groupsummary(tornadoes, "Month", stat, "Total_Damage")
```


| |Month|GroupCount|sum_Total_Damage|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1|January|95|88605000|
|2|February|44|40211000|
|3|March|25|1370000|

bar(cost.Month, cost{:, end})

**Description of code above**


The `groupsummary` function returns a table. The table includes the number of events in each group and the statistic for the selected variable. In this example, the data is grouped by the `Month` variable. The statistic selected in the drop\-down menu is applied to the `Total_Damage` variable. The result is added to the last column of the table. A bar plot is used to visualize the result.

# Closing Remarks

Notice how quickly creating a variety of visualizations provided an overview of lots of data. What have you learned about tornadoes in the United States in 2013? Hopefully you gained a feel for the data. This is important later when trying to evaluate predictive models. Without a feel for the data, it's difficult to look at the output of a complex model and determine if the results are reasonable.

<a id="H_E0B13F0C"></a>

For now, you can state that in 2013:

-  The frequency of tornadoes was less during the winter months than late spring/early summer 
-  Winter tornadoes tend to be in the southern United States 
-  An extremely damaging tornado occurred in November 

Maybe you have a lot more questions. For example, what states are most affected? What do the results look like for different years? This script just looks at tornadoes, what about all the other storm events? The fun, and challenging, aspect of having lots of data is trying to explore all the possible questions and relationships. By the end of this course you'll have the skills to answer these questions and more.


 **Hint.** You can look at other years by changing the year in the filename in the first line of code!
